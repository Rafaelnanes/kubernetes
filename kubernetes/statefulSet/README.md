### Use StatefulSet when your application needs:

#### Stable, Unique Network Identifiers:
- StatefulSet: Pods get predictable names like mysql-0, mysql-1, mysql-2
- Deployment: Random names like mysql-7589f4d559-xj2p9

#### Ordered Pod Creation/Deletion:

- StatefulSet: Pods are created in order (0,1,2) and deleted in reverse order
- Deployment: Pods are created/deleted in any order


### Stable Storage:
- StatefulSet: Each pod keeps its storage when rescheduled
- Deployment: Storage is typically ephemeral
